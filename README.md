<h2> <img src="frontend/src/pictures/backgrounds/logo.png" height="50"/> What is MLforALL </h2>

MLforALL guides you in **learning about** and **experimenting with** machine learning without coding experience. This is done by providing an **accessible** all-in-one platform for machine learning education. We aspire to act as an equalizer in this important field by exposing people to a personalized machine learning experience with three core ideas: create, explore, play.

- **Create.** To create a project, all users need to do is upload data or select one of our examples! MLforAll guides users through a **_step-by-step process_** of creating a model. Follow explanations as to **why** users are choosing certain parameters and read in-depth explanations of different types of models and math.
- **Explore.** As users create their projects, they can **share it with our community** of fellow learners. This offers a great way for both new users to get acquainted with projects and old users to present personal projects they are proud of.
- **Play.** Some learn by doing, others by reading, but most learn by doing both. MLforALL encourages this style of learning with not only an intuitive create process, but also an **in-house platform to test**, experiment with, and play with machine learning models. See what your model would **predict and edit** your models as necessary!
